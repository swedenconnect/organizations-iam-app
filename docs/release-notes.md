### Version 0.9.1

**Date:** TBD

- The admin application can now be deployed under a custom context path
  (e.g. `/iam-admin/`) in addition to the root path, without requiring a
  separate build.
- New API endpoint for listing the rights holders of a given function within
  an organisation. See the API documentation for details.
- When a user's session expires while using the application, API calls now
  detect the expired session and redirect to the login page with a clear
  "session expired" message, instead of silently failing or showing an
  unexpected error.
- Fixed a bug where removing a user's right at the organisation level failed
  with an unexpected error. The delete operation was silently dropping the
  required `right` query parameter before sending the request to the backend.
